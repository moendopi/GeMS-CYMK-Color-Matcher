# GeMS-CYMK-Color-Matcher
Converts CYMK values into FGDC/USGS CYMK values and gives a suggested closely matching CYMK tile

Currently this only runs in the command line. Just enter the CYM values, there is no K value in any of the colors in the CYMK Color Chart.
It is located here: https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd/fgdc-geolsym-colorchart.pdf

Eventually I will likely have this allow RGB input as well. 
Eventually eventually I will probably make this run through a GUI.
